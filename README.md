# Pricing-table-project-CSS-
This HTML code creates a flexbox-based pricing table with three different plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Each plan is contained within a div with the class pricing-plan, displaying the plan title, price, features (listed with icons), and a sign-up button. The overall layout is responsive, adjusting to a single-column layout when the viewport width is less than 1250 pixels, ensuring good display on various devices. The styling includes font imports from Google Fonts and custom CSS for layout, typography, and button design.
